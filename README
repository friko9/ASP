Project build toolset in transition from EDE/Automake to CMake:


EDE (Emacs Development Environment) + Automake
==============================================
Requirements:
none

to install build configure and install check ./INSTALL


CMake
=============================================
Requirements:
Google Test

to build goto root directory and run:
cmake -H. -BRelease -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build Release

to run unit tests use:
cmake --build Release --target test


Description
=============================================
Algorithms and structures represent those found in the book Algorithms+Structures=Programs.
Its made just to understend the nuances of presented algorithms.
Efficiency is comparable as those in standard C++ library.
Also experimented with indipendent-module self-registering used in some unit-testing environments, and configure-run-check testing philosophy variations for repeateable test cases.

IDE - EDE (Emacs Development Environment) + Automake

Algorithms and structures represent those found in the book Algorithms+Structures=Programs.
Its made just to understend the nuances of presented algorithms. Efficiency is comparable as those in standard C++ library.
Also experimented with indipendent-module self-registering used in some unit-testing environments, and configure-run-check testing philosophy variations for repeateable test cases.
